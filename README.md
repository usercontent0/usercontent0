## Hello!!! ðŸ‘‹

Most if not all of the stuff I do on here is written in Lua ðŸ¥°<br>
And nine times out of ten it's either related to EDM festivals or just something that has to do with stages in general.

I also do video editing in my free time using After Effects and Premiere Pro. I've been doing that since 2021, and I'm happy to say that I'm gradually improving.

**Thank you for reading.**
